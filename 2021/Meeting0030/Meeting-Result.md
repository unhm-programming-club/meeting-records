2. Determine which math problems are right and wrong, and why.
	
Davis has had some demanding school projects keeping him up late.

- In his Data structures class, everything has to be programmed in nano and compiled on command line, making testing difficult.

- One data structure project was a doubly linked list which keeps track of contacts. Every node was a person and every person could have up to 5 phone numbers tored. The list had to be searchable. It had no head or tail, only a midpoint which had to be kept balance.  
  
- Davis has continued work on his asana canvas bridge project. It's technically function as it can grab his assignments from Canvas using the API, but duplicates them if run twice. It is available [here](https://github.com/dcm1042/Assignment-Handler)
	
Jared had a big paper non computer science related which required him to analyze a primary and secondary source from a newspaper from 1920. This is his last semester; he will be graduating with a bA in computer science and a minor in data science.
	
#### IT

We know that we will be using some sort of dockerized containers when we work with the IT department. Github has a docker storage feature which integrates with git repos and is something we could look into. Another alternative is Podman. Jared works at Redhat, and that's their alternative to Docker. If we are given a VM with Linux on it, we probably will be able to use Podman instead. This might be better if we have a base container and want to have multiple sub-hosted containers in it; docker doesn't do as well with running other sub-dockers.


#### Club Funds uses

Since we will likely get hosting from IT, it's unclear what the best use of club funds are. Some ideas:

- APIS
  - [OpenAi](https://beta.openai.com/)
- Attend hackathon / programming competition / game jam
- Host hackathon / programming competition / game jam
