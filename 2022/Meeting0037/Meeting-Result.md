### Discussions 

- IT got back to us; a server is available soon. Accessible from a UNH VPN or from the UNH Network. 
- We don't know the address of the server yet or have credentials or full understanding of what we'll be allowed to do on it.
- There's a Club Fair on Wednesday February 2nd, 1-4pm.
	- Tony Pion and Kaitlin McManus said they could both cover the meeting for partial intervals. Davis, Karl, and Derek all can't do it.
- We should reconsider meeting times since there are new schedules for the Spring. Davis' busy days are Monday and Wednesday. Karl is booked Tuesday and Thursday.
